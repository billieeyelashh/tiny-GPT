# tiny-GPT EDU
A tiny GPT written in C++ with utilizing torch based on Andrej Karpathys https://github.com/karpathy/minGPT.

But with easier to understand more structured codebase(atleast I think so) and yeah it's completly in C++

This isn't really meant to used anywhere. Wrote this this morning and must say it was a blast.
Maybe you find this somewhat educational. I still will be adding some things. But the original is great also.

I'm also a big simp of Andrej
